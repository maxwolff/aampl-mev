## Ampleforth Arbitrage MEV Bot

If the upcoming ampleforth rebase would be profitable, borrow from aave right before the rebase, wait until it does happen, and then repay the loan.
Uses a `View.sol` to figure out when the rebase is happening, and if the trade would be profitable.

Uses a local anvil rpc forked from mainnet to deploy the view contract and read values from chain. Uses a ws endpoint to read events. Sends via flashbots private transaction.
